# Project Completion Assessment

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-06  
**Purpose:** Track which projects are "done enough" vs still in active development  
**Status:** Framework Complete - Ready for Project Reviews

## Completion Criteria

A project is considered **"Done Enough"** if:
- ✅ Core functionality is complete
- ✅ Usable/functional (even if not deployed)
- ✅ Active tasks are enhancements, not blockers
- ✅ No critical bugs or missing core features
- ✅ Project serves its intended purpose

A project is **"Not Done"** if:
- ❌ Core features are missing
- ❌ Not usable/functional
- ❌ Active tasks block core functionality
- ❌ Still in early development stages
- ❌ Critical bugs prevent use

**Note:** Deployment is not a requirement for "done enough" status.

**Decision Categories:**
- **"Done Enough"** - Core complete, usable, enhancement-only tasks remain
- **"Not Done"** - Missing core features, not usable, blockers exist
- **"Needs Discussion"** - Unclear status, requires user input

## Assessment Checklist

For each project, review:

- [ ] Check PROJECT_STATUS.md - Understand project status
- [ ] Check README.md - Understand project purpose and scope
- [ ] Check docs/architecture.md - Understand system design (if exists)
- [ ] Assess: Is core functionality complete?
- [ ] Assess: Is it usable/functional?
- [ ] Assess: Are there critical bugs?
- [ ] Decision: "Done Enough" or "Not Done" or "Needs Discussion"?
- [ ] Notes: Any specific concerns or questions?
