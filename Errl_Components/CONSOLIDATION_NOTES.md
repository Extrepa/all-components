# Errl Components - Consolidation Notes

**Created:** 2027-01-07  
**Project:** `Errl_Components`

---

## Overview

Errl Components is the **active React/Three.js component library** and serves as the source of truth for 3D components.

---

## Consolidation Opportunities

### Low Priority

1. **Design System Integration**
   - Current: May have custom styling
   - Consider: Use `shared/design-system/` for consistent styling
   - Benefit: Consistent design across projects

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

### Source of Truth For

- **3D/Three.js Components**
  - Used by projects needing 3D components
  - Primary component library for React/Three.js

### Archived In

- **`all-components`** - Contains copy of these components
  - Archive only, not source of truth
  - Use for reference

---

## Migration Status

- [ ] Design system integration (if applicable)

---

## Notes

- Active component library
- Source of truth for 3D components
- Continue active development
- Add new 3D components here
