# Phase 3 Quick Start Guide

**Created:** 2027-01-07  
**Full Plan:** See [PHASE_3_ACTION_PLAN.md](PHASE_3_ACTION_PLAN.md)

## Quick Overview

Phase 3 focuses on enhancing documentation content, reviewing code, and refining project status once file operations are available.

## Four Main Phases

### 3.1 Content Enhancement
- Enhance architecture documentation with codebase analysis
- Complete project structure documentation
- Extract and document design decisions

### 3.2 Code Review & Verification
- Verify projects build/run successfully
- Assess code quality
- Identify critical bugs

### 3.3 Documentation Review
- Review and enhance existing documentation
- Create usage guides where needed
- Organize any remaining scattered docs

### 3.4 Status Refinement
- Update code completeness percentages
- Refine documentation completeness
- Update overall project status

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with Category A** (3 projects) - Quick wins
2. **Then Category B** (5 projects) - Moderate work
3. **Then Category C** (5 projects) - More content needed
4. **Finally Category D** (7 projects) - Most work needed

## Per Project Checklist

For each project, complete:

- [ ] Enhance `docs/architecture.md` with detailed system info
- [ ] Complete `docs/project-structure.md` with full directory tree
- [ ] Verify project builds (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify project runs (if safe)
- [ ] Assess code quality
- [ ] Review existing documentation content
- [ ] Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with findings
- [ ] Update `PROJECTS_STATUS.json` with refined percentages
- [ ] Update completion checklist

## Time Estimates

- **Per project:** ~2.5-3.5 hours
- **Total (20 projects):** ~60 hours
- Can be done incrementally

## Tracking Progress

Create `PHASE_3_PROGRESS.md` to track:
- Which projects completed
- Issues encountered
- Time spent
- Notes

## Ready to Start?

1. Review [PHASE_3_ACTION_PLAN.md](PHASE_3_ACTION_PLAN.md) for detailed tasks
2. Start with first Category A project
3. Work through tasks systematically
4. Update status files as you go
