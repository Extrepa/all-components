# Project Completion Plan - All 20 Projects

**Created:** 2026-01-10  
**Status:** Planning  
**Total Projects:** 20  
**Estimated Total Effort:** ~522 hours (~65 days at 8h/day, or ~13 weeks)

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to bring all 20 projects to 100% completion across three dimensions:
1. **Documentation** (96h) - Content enhancement, architecture docs, project structure docs
2. **Code** (206h) - Build verification, test coverage, code quality, dependency updates
