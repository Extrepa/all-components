# Long-Term Evolution

Errl OS should:
- remain hackable
- avoid lock-in
- privilege clarity over features

Future directions:
- Sync-aware modules
- Multi-vault support
- Public-facing exports
- AI-assisted reflection (optional)

Never let it become heavy.
Errl OS should feel alive, not managerial.
