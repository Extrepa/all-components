# Errl OS Philosophy & Mental Model

Errl OS is not a productivity system.
It is a **creative ecology**.

## Core Principles
- Capture before organize
- Momentum before completion
- Memory before optimization
- Systems must adapt to humans

## Organ-Based Architecture
Each feature is an independent module ("organ"):
- single responsibility
- optional
- replaceable
- grows when needed

Errl OS should feel alive, not managerial.
