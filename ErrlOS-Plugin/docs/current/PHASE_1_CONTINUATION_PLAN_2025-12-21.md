# Phase 1: Continuation Plan
**Date:** December 21, 2025, 10pm PST  
**Status:** ✅ **7/16 Organs Complete - Ready to Continue**

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed (7/16):
All high-priority organs have ErrorHandler integration:
1. DashboardOrgan
2. CaptureOrgan
3. TimeMachineOrgan
4. SessionGhostOrgan
5. PromotionOrgan
6. LoreEngineOrgan
7. ProjectPulseOrgan

### ⏳ Remaining (9/16):
Lower-priority organs that may have file operations:
1. RitualOrgan
2. RealityMapOrgan
3. DreamBufferOrgan
4. ThoughtRecyclerOrgan
5. AssetBrainOrgan
6. PromptForgeOrgan
7. FrictionScannerOrgan
8. EnergyOrgan
9. EntropyDialOrgan

## Strategy

### Option A: Complete All Organs (Recommended)
- Continue ErrorHandler integration for remaining 9 organs
- Ensures consistency across entire codebase
- May find some organs have minimal/no file operations

### Option B: Move to Next Tasks
- Task 1.2: Command Documentation & Discoverability
- Task 1.3: Session Ghost Status Indicator
- Come back to remaining organs later

## Recommendation

**Continue with remaining organs** - This ensures:
1. Complete consistency
2. All file operations are properly handled
3. No organs are left with inconsistent error handling

## Next Steps

1. Check each remaining organ for file operations
2. Add ErrorHandler integration where needed
3. Verify with linter
4. Document completion
5. Move to Task 1.2 and 1.3
