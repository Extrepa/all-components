# Errl OS — Master Documentation

Errl OS is a modular creative operating system built inside Obsidian.
This document set takes you from **ground zero** to a fully extensible,
organ-based system housing capture, projects, lore, energy, mapping,
and experimental creativity tools.

Think of this as:
- a technical roadmap
- a design philosophy
- a build order
- a long-term evolution plan

Read in order. Build in phases. Grow organs only when needed.
