Nice. Time to slap a sticker on this spaceship and call it Errl OS Alpha. 🚀🫠

I’ll “package” it as if you’re making a GitHub release + Obsidian doc + local folder structure.

Below is a single markdown file you can drop straight into Obsidian as:

Errl-OS-Alpha-Release.md

Inside it, I define:
	•	The project name + version
	•	Folder structure
	•	Which file should contain your big app (the monster index.html we’ve been building)
	•	Release notes, features, and future roadmap

You can also use this as your GitHub README if you want, or split bits off later.

# Errl OS Alpha – FX Lab & Animation Forge

**Codename:** Errl OS – Alpha  
**Version:** `v0.1.0-alpha`  
**Core File:** `index.html` (single-file app, lives in `/app/`)  

Errl OS Alpha is a self-contained, browser-based workstation for turning an Errl SVG into:

- Live FX labs (p5.js, HTML FX, voxels, 3D wireframes)
- Audio-reactive animations
- Captured frame galleries + VS Mode
- Spritesheets, timelines, and game-ready animation packs
- Multi-project save slots
- AI handoff prompts and full session snapshots

All running from a single HTML file, no backend.

## 1. Folder & File Layout

Create this minimal structure:

```text
errl-os-alpha/
├── app/
│   └── index.html          # The full Errl OS Alpha app (the big file we've been building)
├── docs/
│   ├── Errl-OS-Alpha-Release.md  # This file
│   └── Errl-OS-Roadmap.md        # Future feature list (optional)
├── assets/
│   ├── icons/              # Any PNG/SVG icons you add later
│   └── errl/               # Reference SVGs, poses, etc.
├── README.md
├── LICENSE (optional)
└── CHANGELOG.md

Where to put the big app code
	•	Take the latest full index.html version we’ve been building together.
	•	Save it as:

errl-os-alpha/app/index.html



Open that file in a browser (via file:// or a tiny local server) and you’re in Errl OS Alpha.

⸻

2. Running Errl OS Alpha

Option A – Double-click (no server)
	•	Just open app/index.html in Chrome/Brave/Edge.
	•	Most features (p5, Three.js, audio, localStorage) will work fine.
	•	Some browsers may restrict local file access for iframe/audio; if anything feels weird, use a tiny server.

Option B – Tiny local server

From errl-os-alpha/app/:

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# or Node's serve (if installed)
npx serve .

Then visit:

http://localhost:8000/index.html

You now have Errl OS Alpha running like a mini desktop app in your browser.

4. How to Use in Practice (Suggested Workflow)
	1.	Load SVG
	•	Drop in a canonical Errl SVG (front-facing idle or special pose).
	2.	Dial FX
	•	Use p5 tab for wobble/glow motion.
	•	Use HTML FX tab to color-grade.
	•	Optionally add 3D or voxel variants.
	3.	Capture & Tag
	•	Hit C to capture 6–12 frames from a loop.
	•	Right-click thumbnails to tag:
	•	idle, walk, jump, fx, etc.
	•	Star the strongest frames as favorites.
	4.	Export Assets
	•	Use Spritesheet panel for PNG + manifest:
	•	All frames or favorites
	•	Per-tag group (e.g. idle-only sheet)
	•	Use Timeline for visual verification.
	•	Use Animation Pack for game-engine-friendly JSON.
	5.	Save Project
	•	Give the current experiment a name in Projects, e.g.:
	•	Errl Idle – Portal Theme
	•	Errl Walk – Club Sim
	•	Save and move on to the next vibe.
	6.	Hand Off to Other Tools
	•	Build the AI Handoff Prompt.
	•	Paste into another AI or dev environment to:
	•	Generate engine-specific code
	•	Bake sprite logic into games
	•	Document everything in Obsidian

⸻

5. Known Limitations in Alpha
	•	All state is stored in localStorage and in-memory:
	•	Clearing browser storage will lose projects.
	•	Captured frames are base64 PNGs:
	•	Very high resolution + huge frame counts can consume a lot of RAM.
	•	No explicit “file import” for external JSON packs yet:
	•	Timeline / pack import would be a nice future feature.
	•	The app assumes modern desktop browser:
	•	Mobile is not a supported primary target (yet).

⸻

6. Roadmap – Toward Beta

Some obvious next steps beyond Alpha:
	•	Importers
	•	Load existing spritesheet manifests & animation packs.
	•	Map external sprite sheets onto Errl OS timelines.
	•	Better Audio Tools
	•	Per-band reactive controls (bass vs mids vs highs).
	•	Record “automation curves” from audio for later playback without sound.
	•	Advanced Rigging
	•	Multiple SVG layers (face, limbs, accessories) with per-part wobble controls.
	•	Multi-Errl Scenes
	•	Compose scenes with multiple Errls using different presets and timelines.
	•	Export Helpers
	•	One-click Phaser/Pixi snippets using the animation pack.
	•	Export .zip bundles with:
	•	spritesheet.png
	•	animation-pack.json
	•	engine template code
