# Canonical Paths

These paths are fixed and must not be renamed.

- /srv/backups
- /srv/media/movies
- /srv/media/shows
- /srv/web/sites
- /srv/docker

If a feature does not clearly map to one of these,
it does not belong in this system.

This prevents Cursor from inventing /data, /media, /content, /assets_v2, etc.
