# Cursor Project Contract

This project follows strict architectural rules.

Cursor MUST:
- Respect the canonical storage layout
- Use Docker for all services
- Avoid introducing new platforms or tools
- Prefer boring, well-known solutions
- Modify existing files before creating new ones

Cursor MUST NOT:
- Suggest cloud-first replacements
- Introduce paid SaaS dependencies
- Merge unrelated services
- Change folder meanings
- Add features without a clear use case

If a decision is ambiguous:
- Ask for clarification
- Do nothing by default

Why this matters:
Cursor will hallucinate improvements unless you tell it "no."
