Beautiful, this is the right move.
We’ll split the system into clean, single-purpose Markdown files you can drop straight into Obsidian (or any vault). Each file answers one question only. No cognitive soup.

Below is a complete file set, with ready-to-paste Markdown content for each file.

You can create a folder like:

# Home Server Overview

This system provides:

- Access from any computer or mobile device
- Centralized storage (files, photos, music, videos, books, websites, games)
- A private, secure home server
- A cheap, disposable public website
- Zero vendor lock-in

## Core Principle

**One server = one source of truth**

Everything lives on the home server.
The public website is just a projection.

## What This Is Not

- Not a Plex-only media box
- Not a fragile DIY experiment
- Not dependent on any single company

This is a long-term personal infrastructure.

📄 01-Architecture.md

# System Architecture

## Two Worlds, One Domain

### Private (Home Server)
- Ubuntu on Dell OptiPlex 7050
- Docker-based services
- Media vault
- Accessible via secure browser login

### Public (Cheap Host)
- Static website
- Embedded media
- No master files
- Can be deleted and rebuilt anytime

## Traffic Flow

User → Domain → Cloudflare → Home Server (private services)
User → Domain → Cheap Host (public site)

## Why This Works

- Home IP is hidden
- No port forwarding
- Mobile-friendly access
- Public traffic never touches private data


⸻

📄 02-Hardware-Setup.md

# Hardware Setup

## Required Hardware

- Dell OptiPlex 7050
- 2TB–4TB 2.5" SATA SSD (data)
- USB flash drive (Ubuntu installer)
- Ethernet connection

## Optional Hardware

- NVMe SSD for OS
- UPS for power protection

## Installation Order

1. Power off system
2. Install SATA SSD
3. (Optional) Install NVMe SSD
4. Close case
5. Reconnect cables

Do not proceed without confirming drives are seated properly.

📄 03-OS-Install.md

# Ubuntu Server Installation

## Installer Prep

- Download Ubuntu Server LTS
- Flash to USB using balenaEtcher

## Install Settings

- Network: DHCP
- Storage: Guided / Use entire disk
- Enable OpenSSH
- Skip extra snaps

## After Install

- Reboot
- Note server IP
- SSH in from another machine

This system will be headless after this point.

📄 04-Storage-Layout.md

# Canonical Storage Layout

This layout must never change.

```text
/storage
├── files
├── photos
│   ├── originals
│   └── galleries
├── music
│   ├── lossless
│   └── web
├── videos
│   ├── masters
│   └── streams
├── books
├── websites
│   ├── public
│   └── experiments
├── games
│   ├── assets
│   └── builds
└── backups

Rules
	•	One media type per folder
	•	Albums = folders
	•	Originals never modified
	•	Public content always copied, never moved

# 📄 05-Docker-Platform.md

```md
# Docker Platform

## Why Docker

- Reproducible
- Easy to back up
- No dependency rot
- Services stay isolated

## Core Components

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose
- Portainer (management UI)

## Golden Rule

Nothing runs directly on Ubuntu.
Everything runs in containers.


⸻

📄 06-Remote-Access.md

# Remote Access

## Goals

- No port forwarding
- No exposed IP
- Works on mobile networks
- HTTPS everywhere

## Method

- Cloudflare DNS
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- Reverse proxy

## Subdomains

- vault.domain.com
- files.domain.com
- music.domain.com
- photos.domain.com

Access is browser-based only.
No VPN required.


⸻

📄 07-Media-Services.md

# Media Services

Each media type is its own service.

## Files
- Upload/download
- Folder browsing
- Phone-friendly

## Photos
- Folder-based galleries
- Originals preserved
- No auto-reorganization

## Music
- Stream from /music/web
- Lossless kept private
- Album = folder

## Videos
- Stream compressed copies
- Masters never exposed

## Books
- PDF / EPUB
- Read in browser or download

Each service:
- One container
- One subdomain
- Shared authentication


⸻

📄 08-Public-Website.md

# Public Website

## Purpose

- Landing page
- Gallery previews
- Embedded music players
- Contact links

## Hosting

- Cheap shared hosting
- Static files preferred

## Rules

- Never store master files
- Never edit directly on host
- Everything syncs from server

The public site is disposable.


⸻

📄 09-Workflows.md

# Daily Workflows

## Adding Files
Upload to /storage/files

## Photos
1. Upload to originals
2. Copy curated sets to galleries

## Music Release
1. Add FLAC to lossless
2. Encode MP3 to web
3. Embed player on public site

## Website Updates
1. Edit /storage/websites/public
2. Sync to public host

## Games
- Assets in /assets
- Builds in /builds


⸻

📄 10-Backups.md

# Backups

## What Is Backed Up

- /storage
- Docker volumes
- Configuration files

## Backup Strategy

- Daily local snapshots
- Off-machine copy
- Automated, silent

## Philosophy

If backups fail, everything else is irrelevant.

What this gives you
	•	Each file is mentally small
	•	Easy to reorganize or expand
	•	Obsidian-friendly
	•	Printable if needed
	•	Future-proof for Errl OS integration

Next natural upgrades (when you’re ready):
	•	11-Dashboard.md
	•	12-User-Roles.md
	•	13-Automation.md

This is now a real documentation system, not a blob of instructions.
