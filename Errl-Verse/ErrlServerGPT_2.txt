Excellent. We’ll continue by completing the documentation set, moving from conceptual to operational. These next files answer the questions that come up once you actually start using the system every day.

Same rule as before: one file = one job.

You can drop these straight into the same folder.

📄 11-Dashboard.md

# Vault Dashboard

The dashboard is the single control surface for the entire system.

It is intentionally simple.

## Purpose

- One URL to rule them all
- Human navigation layer
- No logic, no backend, no database

## Location

Served from:
- /storage/websites/experiments/dashboard
- Available at: vault.yourdomain.com

## Recommended Layout

- Files
- Photos
- Music
- Videos
- Books
- Websites
- Games
- Admin (Portainer)

Each item is just a link.

## Rules

- Static HTML only
- No authentication logic here
- Auth happens at the service level

The dashboard must never be clever.
It must never break.

📄 12-Containers-Selection.md

# Container Selection Strategy

This document explains *how* to choose containers, not which ones.

## Rules for Choosing Containers

A container is acceptable only if:

- Actively maintained
- Official or well-known image
- Supports volume mounts
- Browser-based UI
- No forced cloud account

## One Service, One Container

Never combine services.
Never stack features.

Bad:
- One container doing files + photos + media

Good:
- One container per media type

## Why This Matters

- Easier upgrades
- Easier backups
- Easier replacement
- Easier debugging

Containers are disposable.
Your data is not.

📄 13-Authentication.md

# Authentication Model

## Goals

- One login per user
- No public access to private services
- Works on mobile and desktop

## Model

- Authentication handled by reverse proxy or per-service
- Dashboard itself has no auth
- Services require login

## User Types (Future)

- Owner (you)
- Collaborator
- Viewer

Do not implement roles until needed.

## Rule

Security is boring by design.
If it feels fancy, it’s probably fragile.

📄 14-Mobile-Use.md

# Mobile Usage Guide

This system is designed to be mobile-first.

## What Works on Mobile

- File uploads
- Music streaming
- Photo galleries
- Video playback
- Book reading

## What Does NOT Happen on Mobile

- Server configuration
- Docker management
- System updates

Mobile devices are for consumption and light uploads.
Administration stays on desktop.

## Key Rule

If something is annoying on mobile, simplify the UI.
Do not add features.

📄 15-Sync-and-Sharing.md

# Sync and Sharing

## Internal Sync

- All data lives on the server
- Devices access via browser
- No bidirectional sync tools

## Public Sharing

Only approved content is copied outward.

Examples:
- Music previews
- Gallery exports
- Website builds

## Forbidden

- Syncing the entire vault to laptops
- Letting public services write back to the server

The server is authoritative.
Everything else is a mirror.

📄 16-Maintenance.md

# Maintenance

## Weekly

- Check disk space
- Verify backups completed
- Apply OS updates

## Monthly

- Update containers
- Review unused data
- Clean temporary files

## Yearly

- Test restore from backup
- Review domain + DNS
- Replace aging drives if needed

## Philosophy

Maintenance should be boring and predictable.
If it becomes exciting, something is wrong.

📄 17-Failure-Scenarios.md

# Failure Scenarios

## If the Public Host Dies

- Nothing important is lost
- Re-upload from /storage/websites/public
- Domain stays the same

## If the Home Server Goes Down

- Public site still works
- Vault temporarily unavailable
- Restore from backups

## If You Make a Mistake

- Containers can be rebuilt
- Data remains intact
- Nothing is permanent except folders

This system is resilient by design.


⸻

📄 18-Future-Extensions.md

# Future Extensions

These are intentionally not implemented yet.

## Possible Additions

- User accounts
- Media playlists
- Errl OS UI layer
- Automation scripts
- Scheduled releases
- Collaboration spaces

## Rule

Do not build extensions until:
- The base system is boring
- You use it daily
- A real need appears

Power comes from restraint.

📄 19-Rules-of-the-System.md

# Rules of the System

1. One server = one source of truth
2. One media type per folder
3. Containers are disposable
4. Data is sacred
5. Public services never write inward
6. If unsure, do nothing

Breaking rules leads to entropy.

📄 20-Quick-Start.md

# Quick Start Checklist

☐ Install Ubuntu Server  
☐ Install Docker  
☐ Mount /storage  
☐ Deploy reverse proxy  
☐ Enable Cloudflare Tunnel  
☐ Deploy file service  
☐ Test access from phone  
☐ Add photos  
☐ Add music  
☐ Create public site  

If files work on your phone, the system works.

Where you are now

You now have:
	•	A complete, modular documentation system
	•	Clear separation between build, use, and future ideas
	•	A setup that scales without rewrites
	•	Something you can actually live inside

Next natural continuations (choose when ready):
	•	exact container recommendations (opinionated list)
	•	a printable “build day” checklist
	•	a minimal HTML dashboard template
	•	automation scripts (sync, backups, encoding)

This is no longer theory.
This is infrastructure you’ll grow into.
