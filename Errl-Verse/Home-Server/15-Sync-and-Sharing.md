# Sync and Sharing

## Internal Sync

- All data lives on the server
- Devices access via browser
- No bidirectional sync tools

## Public Sharing

Only approved content is copied outward.

Examples:
- Media previews
- Gallery exports
- Website builds

## Forbidden

- Syncing the entire vault to laptops
- Letting public services write back to the server

The server is authoritative.
Everything else is a mirror.
