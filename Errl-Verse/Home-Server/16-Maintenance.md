# Maintenance

## Weekly

- Check disk space
- Verify backups completed
- Apply OS updates

## Monthly

- Update containers
- Review unused data
- Clean temporary files

## Yearly

- Test restore from backup
- Review domain + DNS
- Replace aging drives if needed

## Philosophy

Maintenance should be boring and predictable.
If it becomes exciting, something is wrong.
