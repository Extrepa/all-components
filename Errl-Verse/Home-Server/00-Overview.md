# Home Server Overview

This system provides:

- Access from any computer or mobile device
- Centralized storage (files, photos, music, videos, books, websites, games)
- A private, secure home server
- A cheap, disposable public website
- Zero vendor lock-in

## Core Principle

**One server = one source of truth**

Everything lives on the home server.
The public website is just a projection.

## What This Is Not

- Not a Plex-only media box
- Not a fragile DIY experiment
- Not dependent on any single company

This is a long-term personal infrastructure.
