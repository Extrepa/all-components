# Future Extensions

These are intentionally not implemented yet.

## Possible Additions

- User accounts
- Media playlists
- Errl OS UI layer
- Automation scripts
- Scheduled releases
- Collaboration spaces

## Rule

Do not build extensions until:
- The base system is boring
- You use it daily
- A real need appears

Power comes from restraint.
