## Purpose

These references serve as:
- **Visual Inspiration** - Design direction and aesthetic goals
- **Asset Reference** - Reference for creating or sourcing 3D models

Located in `nightclub/`:
- Stage equipment references

- Low-poly game-ready model references

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Reference Only** - These are design references, not assets to be directly imported
2. **Inspiration** - Use for visual direction and design decisions
3. **Asset Creation** - Reference when creating or sourcing 3D models
4. **Style Consistency** - Maintain visual consistency with reference aesthetic

## Integration

These references inform:
- `src/scene/RoomBuilder.js` - Room construction
- `src/scene/rooms/` - Room definitions
- `src/scene/LightingSetup.js` - Lighting configuration

## Adding New References

When adding new design references:
1. Create a new subdirectory for the category
