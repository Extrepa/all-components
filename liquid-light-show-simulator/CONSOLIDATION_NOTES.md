# Liquid Light Show Simulator - Consolidation Notes

**Created:** 2027-01-07  
**Project:** `liquid-light-show-simulator`

---

## Overview

Liquid Light Show Simulator is a simple Canvas2D blob simulation. It is superseded by the more advanced `psychedelic-liquid-light-show`.

---

## Consolidation Decision

### Recommendation: Archive

**Reasoning:**
1. `psychedelic-liquid-light-show` has all features of simple version
2. Advanced version is actively maintained
3. Simple version serves as learning/reference
4. No unique features in simple version

**Action:**
- Archive this project
- Document as superseded by advanced version
- Keep for reference only

---

## Migration Status

- [x] Decision made: Archive
- [ ] Archive documentation created
- [ ] Project references updated

---

## Notes

- Simple version: Canvas2D, TypeScript/Vite, basic blob simulation
- Advanced version: PIXI.js/WebGL, realistic physics, AI palettes
- No migration needed - archive only
