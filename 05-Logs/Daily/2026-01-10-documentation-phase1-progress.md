## Build Verification Status

### Successful Builds ✅
- **ErrlOS-Plugin**: ✅ Builds successfully (296.8kb main.js)

### Build Issues (Sandbox Restrictions)
The following projects have build scripts but cannot be verified in the sandbox environment due to Vite's need to write temporary files to `node_modules/.vite-temp/`:

- **errl_scene_builder**: Build script exists, needs verification outside sandbox
- **errl_vibecheck**: Build script exists, needs verification outside sandbox
- **errl-forge---asset-remixer**: Build script exists, needs verification outside sandbox
- **errlstory_pivot_v8**: Build script exists, needs verification outside sandbox

### No Build Script
- **ErrlFXLab**: No build script (vanilla JS project, opens index.html directly)
- **Errl-Verse**: Documentation project, no build needed
