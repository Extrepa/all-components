## Build Verification Status

### Successful Builds ✅
- **ErrlOS-Plugin**: ✅ Builds successfully (296.8kb main.js)

### Build Issues (Sandbox Restrictions)
The following Vite projects cannot be verified in the sandbox environment due to Vite's need to write temporary files:
- errl_scene_builder
- errl_vibecheck
- errl-forge---asset-remixer
- errlstory_pivot_v8
- errl-fluid
- errl-club
- liquid-light-show-simulator
- multi-tool-app
- psychedelic-liquid-light-show
- svg_editor

**Note:** These projects have build scripts and should be verified outside the sandbox environment.

### No Build Script / Different Build Process
- **ErrlFXLab**: Vanilla JS project (opens index.html directly)
- **Errl-Verse**: Documentation project (no build needed)
- **errl-galaxy**: Next.js project (needs verification)
- **universal-component-extractor**: Electron app (needs verification)
- **rainbowrider**: Unity project (needs Unity Editor)
